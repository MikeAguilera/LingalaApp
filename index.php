                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                    Lingala is a lingua franca or trade language spoken in the areas on both sides of the Congo River from Kinshasa up to about a hundred 
                    miles from Kisangani. Lingala, usually called Mangala by Africans, was originally the language of the Bamangala, a Bantu tribe that has
                    almost completely disappeared. Most speakers of Lingala are native speakers of another language and use Lingala as a means of communicating 
                    with other tribal groups and to a lesser extent with Europeans; however, there is a growing number of younger people, especially in urban 
                    centers such as Kinshasa, whose native language is Lingala. Slnce Lingala is spoken by so many people of varied linguistic backgrounds, 
                    it ii invevitable that the language as spoken in different areas should vary to a greater or lesser degree.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The speaker on whose speech these materials are based is from Kinshasa, a child of parents who could not speak each other's language and 
                    who consequently always spoke Lingala with each other and with their children. Lingala has been a written language for quite some time, 
                    but unfortunately written or 'literary' Lingala is different in many ways from Lingala as it is nearly always spoken by Africans. One can 
                    say without hesitat1on that literary Lingala is an invention of Europeans who have tried to 'improve' on the language, because Africans 
                    who speak Lingala fluently have trouble understanding literary Lingala even when it is spoken. This guide is based strictly on Lingala as 
                    spoken by the average Congolese.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The transcription system used in this website is the orthography regularly used to write Lingala plus diacritic markings to indicate tone, 
                    Which is not usually written, and to make it clear how a word or segment is pronounced in cases where the student may have difficulty 
                    interpreting the orthograhy. <!--Some words have been respelled, but this is indicated in the footnotes the first
                    time the respelllng occurs.-->
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Lingala contains many words borrowed both from African and European languages. It is often difficult, if not impossible, to recognize words borrowed from
                    other Bantu languages. Since most of the people who speak Lingala are native speakers of some other language, words from other languages are constantly 
                    used in Lingala.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A number of Arablc words have come in via Swahili. Portuguese and French words have been borrowed for several centuries, and many such words have been 
                    so fully assimilated into the sound system that they too are very hard to recognize. A number of English words also have entered. French words are freely
                    used in everyday speech in a more or less unassimilated form. Those persons who speak French fluently also try to pronounce French words as they would be 
                    in French when these words are used in Lingala. Assimilated words occuring in this text are spelled as pronounced in Lingala, and the first time they occur, 
                    the standard French spelling is given in parentheses, e.g., /leta/ (l'etat), 'government'. Words recently borrowed and not assimilated into the Lingala sound
                    system are given the standard French spelling in the Lingala text. Unassimilated French tones usually have a high tone on the final syllable. The diacritic 
                    marks on French words are NOT tone marks, but they are the same as those regularly used in French spelling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Lingala, like almost all the languages spoken south of the Sahara, is a tone language. Each syllable has its own tone. Tone
                    is as much an integral part of a syllable as vowels and consonants. Words are distinguished by tone, e.g., /ng&aacute;&aacute;/, 'I', 'me' (a low
                    and two highs), and /ngai/, 'scur(ness)', 'bitter(ness)' (three lows). Lingala has two contrastive or phonemic tones: high / ' /, low / &nbsp; / (unmarked). 
                    However, ther'e are many speakers of Lingala who use a stress system instead of tones. Most speakers who use a stress system stress the penultimate syllable. 
                    Because of these speakers and because tone has a smaller phonemlc Yield, i.e., plays a smaller role, in Lingala than in the great majority of
                    African languages, one can obviously communicate in Lingala without using it's tone system. But the majority of speakers of the language do use tone, 
                    including the speaker used as the model for this guide.

                    Sentence intonatlon, e.g., use of pitch to distinguish statements and questions, is also used in Lingala. In the four column chart given below, column I gives the orthography,
                    cloumn II gives the phonemes, column III gives the phonetic symbols, and column IV is an approximation of the sound using American English and French sounds for 
                    comparison.
